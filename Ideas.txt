Make spaceship inaccessible until player has traveled to 5 other towns, completed their challenges and/or
destroyed them, and learns new tech from each city. Allow collection of alien alloy regardless.
Technologies should be:
	1. Temple (gives 'spiritual' perk; allows spiritual ground (new area) to bestow temporary blessing. No food or water
		consumed for 20 steps)
	2. Barracks (build to assign villagers to soldier duty. Armed with no armor and no weapons initially,
	   	separate buttons from player armor and weapons to arm whole army
		army power = (armor val * # soldiers) + (weap val * # soldiers)
	3. Refugee Camp (no more plague or disease, allows for creation of 'Adrenaline Shot' which revives player upon
		death and grants invulnerability for 5 steps. Costs )
	4. Technology Center(
	5. Fine Arts (
