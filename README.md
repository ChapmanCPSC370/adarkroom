### My progress/goals
* (Done) Make spaceship inaccessible until player has traveled to civilizations and completed their challenges.

* (Done) Add 'worldly' perk to allow completion of game

* Civilizations:
	- (Done) Grand Temple: gives 'spiritual' perk; allows shrine (new area) to bestow temporary blessing. No food or water consumed for 20 steps
	- Military Stronghold: gives ability to build Modern Armor, this armor is far stronger steel armor.
	- Refugee Camp: gives 'immune' perk; no more plague or disease.
	- Technology Center: Allows for creation of 'Adrenaline Shot' which revives player upon death and grants invulnerability for 5 steps.
	- (Not included in final draft) Final City: N/A (Another alien wanderer may live here? May be your brother)

* (Done) Completed civilizations randomly offer gifts to city

* (Done) Add 'spiritual' perk to allow use of shrines

* (Done) Update item costs to be more realistic

* (Done) Make challenge packages for each city

* Create escape button for battles; randomly move character 3 spaces away from position

* Add 'civilized' perk once two city challenges have been completed. (Not sure what it will do yet)

* (Done) Figure out how to notify system when city is visited & quest is begun

* (Done) Add an end-game score display for players to save and compare scores.

* (Done) Add new 'civilizations:' column to room display for creating packs

* (Done) Lights off upon page load instead of on

I will be adding more once I complete this list...
