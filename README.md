### My progress/goals
* (Done) Make spaceship inaccessible until player has traveled to civilizations and completed their challenges.
* (Done) Add 'worldly' perk to allow completion of game
* Civilizations:
	- (Done) Grand Temple: gives 'spiritual' perk; allows shrine (new area) to bestow temporary blessing. No food or water consumed for 20 steps
	- Military Stronghold: gives ability to build Modern Armor, this armor is far stronger steel armor.
	- Refugee Camp: no more plague or disease, allows for creation of 'Adrenaline Shot' which revives player upon death and grants invulnerability for 5 steps.
	- Technology Center: N/A
	- Final City: N/A (Another alien wanderer may live here? May be your brother)
* (Done) Add 'spiritual' perk to allow use of shrines
* (Done) Update item costs to be more realistic
* (Done) Make challenge packages for each city
* Create escape button for battles; randomly move character 3 spaces away from position
* Add 'civilized' perk once 3 city challenges have been completed. (Not sure what it will do yet)
* Figure out how to notify system when city is visited & quest is begun

I will be adding more once I complete this list...
