---- My progress/goals ----
1. (Done) Make spaceship inaccessible until player has traveled to civilizations and completed their challenges.
2. (Done) Add 'worldly' perk to allow completion of game
3. Civilizations:
	1. (Done) Grand Temple: gives 'spiritual' perk; allows shrine (new area) to bestow temporary blessing. No food or water consumed for 20 steps
	2. Military Stronghold: gives ability to build Modern Armor, this armor is far stronger steel armor.
	3. Refugee Camp: no more plague or disease, allows for creation of 'Adrenaline Shot' which revives player upon death and grants invulnerability for 5 steps.
	4. Technology Center: N/A
	5. Final City: N/A (Another alien wanderer may live here? May be your brother)
4. (Done) Add 'spiritual' perk to allow use of shrines
5. (Done) Update item costs to be more realistic
6. (Done) Make challenge packages for each city
7. Create escape button for battles; randomly move character 3 spaces away from position
8. Add 'civilized' perk once 3 city challenges have been completed. (Not sure what it will do yet)
9. Figure out how to notify system when city is visited & quest is begun

I will be adding more once I complete this list...
